# Guess_the_number
This Java program is a simple number guessing game where the system randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user has 5 chances to guess it correctly. After each guess, the program provides hintsâ€”whether the correct number is higher or lower. If guessed correctly, it congratulates the user; otherwise, it reveals the number.
